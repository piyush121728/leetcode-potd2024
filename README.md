Welcome to my LeetCode 2024 Daily Challenge Solutions repository! Here, you'll find my solutions to the daily problems from LeetCode.

## Introduction

LeetCode offers a Daily Challenge where a new coding problem is presented every day. This repository contains my solutions to these daily problems. I've tried to provide clean, well-documented code for each solution.

## Folder Structure

The repository is organized by the problem number, and within each folder, you'll find solutions. The structure looks like this:
